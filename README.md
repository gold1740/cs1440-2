# Cloning this repository on your computer

You do not need to use `git init` for this assignment; `git clone` will create
a new repo and fill it with my starter code.  You will need to create an empty
*private* repo on Bitbucket so that you can have a place to push your work.
Before you can push your code to Bitbucket, you must make the newly cloned repo
on your computer aware of your Bitbucket repo.  It already knows that it came
from my Bitbucket repo by virtue of it being a clone; it recognizes my repo by
the name 'origin'.  You shall add your repository under a new name.

In a nutshell:

    $ git clone https://bitbucket.org/erikfalor/cs1440-falor-erik-assn2 cs1440-LASTNAME-FIRSTNAME-assn2
    $ cd cs1440-LASTNAME-FIRSTNAME-assn2
    $ git remote add myrepo git@bitbucket.org:YOUR_USERNAME/cs1440-LASTNAME-FIRSTNAME-assn2
    $ git push -u myrepo master

Direct your questions about this process to the tutors and the TAs who are
well-prepared to assist you with this configuration.


# Runtime Behavior

See the files under `examples/` for examples of what a correct program's output
may look like.  Test your program against the files under `data/` and compare
your output to the provided examples.  Your program should match the example
output in the essentials; extra leading or trailing white space is generally
permissible, except where its presence changes the meaning of the output.

In the samples provided online, lines beginning with `$` represent the command
I typed into my shell.  When you run the same command you should not copy the
`$`.
